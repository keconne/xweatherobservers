# Extreme Weather Observers
Develop a real-time weather data-fusion explorer using the GaiaViz app (3D data engine). A proof-of-concept that incorporates real-time IoT sensors (water monitoring, traffic, etc.) and weather-based news events (data provided by Erasmus.AI). We aim to enhance the interactive exploration of extreme weather events to aid decision-making at a higher-level and facilitate community planning at the grass-roots level. By enabling stakeholders to intuitively visualize complex 3D weather data in real-time, we intend to improve resilience and disaster management. Data sources will include a year of extreme weather news events, and other public data sources, such as telemetric data streams from MQTT brokers and REST (JSON). Deliverables include a 3D interactive visualization that fuses these multiple data types. Visualizing human based news events and layering them with real-time telemetric field sensors may improve early detection and improve disaster response effectiveness.
