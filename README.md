# Extreme Weather Observers
Develop a real-time weather data-fusion explorer using the GaiaViz app (3D data engine). A proof-of-concept that incorporates real-time IoT sensors (water monitoring, traffic, etc.) and weather-based news events (data provided by Erasmus.AI). We aim to enhance the interactive exploration of extreme weather events to aid decision-making at a higher-level and facilitate community planning at the grass-roots level. By enabling stakeholders to intuitively visualize complex 3D weather data in real-time, we intend to improve resilience and disaster management. Data sources will include a year of extreme weather news events, and other public data sources, such as telemetric data streams from MQTT brokers and REST (JSON). Deliverables include a 3D interactive visualization that fuses these multiple data types. Visualizing human based news events and layering them with real-time telemetric field sensors may improve early detection and improve disaster response effectiveness. 

Step 1: Introduction to GaiaViz data scaping app: understand the available visual parameters and interactivity features to create adequate data transformation process. 

Step 2: Establish the data transformation process necessary to map the data parameter around the datascape, using a data flow diagram. This step allows to anticipate the intermediary states (i.e., for aggregation purpose) to identify potential data enrichments needed and to choose scaling methods that retains the data meaning (i.e., normalization, standardization). 

Step 3: Implement the diagram from Step 2 into a set a python scripts, test and adjust the datascape. 

Step 4: Prepare the datascape for use by creating a set of camera views around the most interesting areas. Record a video tour of the datascape for your presentation.
