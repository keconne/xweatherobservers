# 3D Extreme Weather Observation; Wildfire Visual Explorer

An interactive 3D data visualization tool for analyzing extreme weather events, with a focus on wildfires and their impact on human populations.

## Overview

This project leverages advanced 3D visualization techniques to explore historical extreme weather data. The primary focus is on wildfires, allowing users to analyze fire spread, population impacts, and risk mitigation strategies. Key stakeholders include community planners, urban developers, government officials, policy makers, emergency responders, insurance professionals, climate scientists, and other researchers. 

## Objectives

* Develop an interactive 3D visualization in Gaiaviz to show wildfire patterns and impacts

* Integrate historical weather data from Erasmus.ai and other data sources as needed

* Provide value to wildfire SMEs and Gaiaviz stakeholders by leveraging powerful Gaiaviz capabilities to effectively visualize critical wildfire data

* Ensure scalabe development to allow future projects to predictive analytics, other extreme weather events, or more regions

## Data

Our primary data source [Erasmus.ai](https://erasmus.ai/) includes location and other metadata surrounding extreme weather events, including wildfires. We plan to use this data to visualize wildfire density along with potentially related weather events and conditions within regions of interest. We may supplement this data source with news data or other sources to fully incorporate impact to human populations.

## Project Plan

**Step 1:** Introduction to GaiaViz data visualization app: understand the available visual parameters and interactivity features to create adequate data transformation process.

**Step 2:** Establish the data transformation process necessary to map the data parameter around the datascape, using a data flow diagram. This step allows to anticipate the intermediary states (i.e., for aggregation purpose) to identify potential data enrichments needed and to choose scaling methods that retains the data meaning (i.e., normalization, standardization).

**Step 3:** Implement the diagram from Step 2 into a set a python scripts, test and adjust the datascape.

**Step 4:** Prepare the datascape for use by creating a set of camera views around the most interesting areas. Record a video tour of the datascape for the presentation.
