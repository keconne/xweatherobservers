Even if it were to rain buckets for 40 days and 40 nights, government would hesitate to declare an end to a drought. After the last drought, many of us continued our water-saving habits. Government seems to have narrowed its definition of drought to just \u201ca shortage of water\u201d \u2014 no matter how much Mother Nature gives us. But don\u2019t blame the drought.

The term \"megadrought\" is generally defined as an extended period where rainfall levels remain below average for many years. \"Megadroughts typically refer to droughts that are very severe and also span many years . The severe drought in the Southwest of North America is considered to be the longest and driest extended period of drought the region has seen in more than 1,000 years. \"The drought started around the turn of the century and has carried on pretty much unabated since then, with only limited rainfall providing some relief in some parts,\" Cloke said. \"This region of the Americas has experienced long periods of drought before, with perhaps two or three megadroughts each century over the past 2,000 years. But this megadrought stands out from the record as being particularly long lasting.\" The long-lasting drought has led to severe water shortages in areas of the Southwest, with major decreases in the water levels of key reservoirs, including Lake Mead and Lake Powell, two reservoirs on the Colorado River. \"This megadrought, or prolonged period of dryness, has lasted some two decades now in the Southwest leading to a real decline in our two major reservoirs in the basin\u2014Lake Mead and Lake Powell,\" Andrea K. Gerlak, a geography professor at the University of Arizona, told Newsweek. While the recent rains have refilled the reservoirs across many of the states significantly, including Lake Oroville and Lake Shasta in California, the drought won't be entirely lifted until the groundwater stores are replenished.

If the drought continues for much longer, water shortages may become an increasingly large issue across the country. \"The impacts of severe drought can have enormous consequences on agricultural ecosystems and water supplies, including declining productivity and reduced groundwater and reservoir supplies that supply fresh water to cities and towns,\" Erica Smithwick, a professor of geography at Penn State, told Newsweek. Additionally, the drought will increase the risk of forest fires, reduce power generation capacity from hydroelectric dams, and lead to the deaths of many species of animals and plants. This was not the case with previous comparable droughts , which were primarily caused by lack of precipitation. With climate change, temperatures are likely to continue to increase, exacerbating the risks for such prolonged droughts,\" Hadjimichael said. \"We know that climate change as a result of human activity is already making droughts worse. This is one of the reasons why extreme weather is getting more extreme\u2014heavy rainfall can be even heavier, and droughts can last longer,\" Cloke said.

The term \"megadrought\" is generally defined as an extended period where rainfall levels remain below average for many years. \"Megadroughts typically refer to droughts that are very severe and also span many years . The severe drought in the Southwest of North America is considered to be the longest and driest extended period of drought the region has seen in more than 1,000 years. \"The drought started around the turn of the century and has carried on pretty much unabated since then, with only limited rainfall providing some relief in some parts,\" Cloke said. \"This region of the Americas has experienced long periods of drought before, with perhaps two or three megadroughts each century over the past 2,000 years. But this megadrought stands out from the record as being particularly long lasting.\" The long-lasting drought has led to severe water shortages in areas of the Southwest, with major decreases in the water levels of key reservoirs, including Lake Mead and Lake Powell, two reservoirs on the Colorado River. \"This megadrought, or prolonged period of dryness, has lasted some two decades now in the Southwest leading to a real decline in our two major reservoirs in the basin\u2014Lake Mead and Lake Powell,\" Andrea K. Gerlak, a geography professor at the University of Arizona, told Newsweek. While the recent rains have refilled the reservoirs across many of the states significantly, including Lake Oroville and Lake Shasta in California, the drought won't be entirely lifted until the groundwater stores are replenished.

If the drought continues for much longer, water shortages may become an increasingly large issue across the country. \"The impacts of severe drought can have enormous consequences on agricultural ecosystems and water supplies, including declining productivity and reduced groundwater and reservoir supplies that supply fresh water to cities and towns,\" Erica Smithwick, a professor of geography at Penn State, told Newsweek. Additionally, the drought will increase the risk of forest fires, reduce power generation capacity from hydroelectric dams, and lead to the deaths of many species of animals and plants. This was not the case with previous comparable droughts , which were primarily caused by lack of precipitation.

Resilience Beyond wildfires, T-Mobile is also leveraging 5G and its resources to provide critical on-the-ground response to communities affected by major weather events. 2023 and beyond In the coming years, we will see 5G continue to play a critical role in spotting wildfires and other natural disasters well before they can be detected by other technologies, with the hopes that such detection techniques can be replicated on a global scale.", "severity": 0.129, "event_locations": ["America", "Portland", "Oregon"], "article_title": "How 5G is ushering in a new era of disaster response | Meteorological Technology International", "times": ["massive winter", "2023"], "probability": 0.5900000000000001, "event_date": "2023-02-14T06:46:35.000000", "article_uri": "https://www.meteorologicaltechnologyinternational.com/features/how-5g-is-ushering-in-a-new-era-of-disaster-response.html", "translated": false, "article_index": "dashboard_climate_events_articles_translate"}], "start_date": "2023-02-14T06:46:35.000000"}}, {"_index": "event_database", "_id": "dKXjAIgBYQoGEGkadexd", "_score": 0.76191604, "_source": {"number_of_locations": 4, "end_date": "2023-02-14T06:59:54.000000", "runner_up": 16.521754392729278, "severity": 0.4, "country": "USA", "score": 24.249476942291537, "probability": 1.2200000000000002, "number_of_sources": 2, "locations": [{"name": "Ithaca", "id": "0000205462", "location": {"lat": 43.2917, "lon": -84.6075}, "population": 30788, "number": 1, "score": 0.5263157894736842, "parent_country": "USA", "parent": "0000205217", "success": true, "is_altername": false}, {"name": "New York", "id": "0000208422", "location": {"lat": 40.7127753, "lon": -74.0059728}, "population": 20201249, "number": 2, "score": 1.0, "parent_country": "USA", "parent": "0000197133", "success": true, "is_altername": false}, {"parent": "0000199541", "is_altername": false, "success": true, "name": "New Haven", "location": {"lon": -72.92816, "lat": 41.30815}, "parent_country": "USA", "id": "0000199631", "population": 5123}, {"parent": "0000197133", "is_altername": false, "success": true, "name": "Connecticut", "location": {"lon": -73.087749, "lat": 41.6032207}, "parent_country": "USA", "id": "0000199541", "population": 3605944}], "event": "drought", "articles": [{"article_id": "2h6M8YYB2sY1SAk0fX5v", "summary": "\u201cOne year of real drought across a large area wrecks lives even in the modern world,\u201d Sturt Manning, an archaeologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and a co-author of the paper, told Nature.

The term \"megadrought\" is generally defined as an extended period where rainfall levels remain below average for many years. \"Megadroughts typically refer to droughts that are very severe and also span many years . The severe drought in the Southwest of North America is considered to be the longest and driest extended period of drought the region has seen in more than 1,000 years. \"The drought started around the turn of the century and has carried on pretty much unabated since then, with only limited rainfall providing some relief in some parts,\" Cloke said. \"This region of the Americas has experienced long periods of drought before, with perhaps two or three megadroughts each century over the past 2,000 years. But this megadrought stands out from the record as being particularly long lasting.\" The long-lasting drought has led to severe water shortages in areas of the Southwest, with major decreases in the water levels of key reservoirs, including Lake Mead and Lake Powell, two reservoirs on the Colorado River. \"This megadrought, or prolonged period of dryness, has lasted some two decades now in the Southwest leading to a real decline in our two major reservoirs in the basin\u2014Lake Mead and Lake Powell,\" Andrea K. Gerlak, a geography professor at the University of Arizona, told Newsweek. While the recent rains have refilled the reservoirs across many of the states significantly, including Lake Oroville and Lake Shasta in California, the drought won't be entirely lifted until the groundwater stores are replenished.

If the drought continues for much longer, water shortages may become an increasingly large issue across the country. \"The impacts of severe drought can have enormous consequences on agricultural ecosystems and water supplies, including declining productivity and reduced groundwater and reservoir supplies that supply fresh water to cities and towns,\" Erica Smithwick, a professor of geography at Penn State, told Newsweek. Additionally, the drought will increase the risk of forest fires, reduce power generation capacity from hydroelectric dams, and lead to the deaths of many species of animals and plants. This was not the case with previous comparable droughts , which were primarily caused by lack of precipitation. With climate change, temperatures are likely to continue to increase, exacerbating the risks for such prolonged droughts,\" Hadjimichael said. \"We know that climate change as a result of human activity is already making droughts worse. This is one of the reasons why extreme weather is getting more extreme\u2014heavy rainfall can be even heavier, and droughts can last longer,\" Cloke said.

Officials noted that the service has worked to prepare for both wildfire and all-hazard emergency responses around the state, such as with its response to Winter Storm Mara and the Deer Park/Pasadena tornado.", "severity": 0.053, "event_locations": ["Texas", "San Angelo", "Lubbock", "Midland", "Texas", "Texas", "Texas"], "article_title": "Texas A&M Forest Service warns of increased fire danger amid high winds", "times": ["on wednesday", ". wednesday", "by thursday", "2023", "to winter"], "probability": 0.21000000000000005, "event_date": "2023-02-15T03:17:24.000000", "article_uri": "https://www.myhighplains.com/news/local-news/texas-am-forest-service-warns-of-increased-fire-danger-amid-high-winds/", "translated": false, "article_index": "dashboard_climate_events_articles_translate"}], "start_date": "2023-02-15T02:19:34.000000"}}, {"_index": "event_database", "_id": "7b08TYgBYQoGEGkaW50Y", "_score": 0.76191604, "_source": {"articles": [{"article_index": "dashboard_climate_events_articles_translate", "article_id": "Sx568YYB2sY1SAk0RXUC", "article_title": "Texas A&M Forest Service warns of increased fire danger amid high winds", "article_uri": "https://www.myhighplains.com/news/local-news/texas-am-forest-service-warns-of-increased-fire-danger-amid-high-winds/", "event_locations": ["Texas"], "times": ["and winter", "on wednesday", "2023", "to winter"], "event_date": "2023-02-15T03:17:24.000000", "summary": "In the High Plains, high wind and winter storm warnings and advisories were in place on Wednesday for most counties, with windy conditions expected to continue for the next week. \u201cEven as we engage in response activities to support our partners and local jurisdictions impacted by Winter Storm Mara, we have personnel positioned across areas of concern that are prepared to respond to any new wildfire ignition.\u201d The service noted that so far in 2023 it has responded to 38 wildfires for 1,272 acres burned across Texas.

analysis for the proposed Portuguese Bend Landslide Remediation Project.

There could be a significant movement that may be very catastrophic and that\u2019s why this is very important.\u201d The Peninsula received a hint of the damage landslides could do late last year, when boulders and other debris rained down from a hillside to the beach below in Palos Verdes Estates, adjacent to Torrance. While that landslide \u2014 which caused only minimal property damage \u2014 did not occur in the PBL area, it did illustrate the fluidity of the Peninsula\u2019s coastline.

California has also faced severe water restrictions during its recent multiyear drought. There are growing concerns that many regions of the world will face water crises like these in the coming decades as rising temperatures exacerbate drought conditions. Globally, one in 12 people could face extreme drought related to water storage every year by the end of this century, compared to an average of about one in 33 at the end of the 20th century. However, our new findings, using multiple models, indicate that the declines in total water storage, including deep groundwater stores, may lead to more water shortages during dry seasons when trees need stored water the most and exacerbate future droughts. There are different kinds of droughts. Meteorological droughts are caused by lack of precipitation. Agricultural droughts are caused by lack of water in soils. Hydrological droughts involve lack of water in rivers and groundwater. We provided a new perspective on droughts by looking at the total water storage. We found that moderate to severe droughts involving water storage would increase until the middle of the 21st century, then remain stable under future scenarios in which countries cut their emissions. But extreme to exceptional water storage droughts could continue to increase until the end of the century. These declines in water storage and increases in future droughts are primarily driven by climate change, not land-water management activities such as irrigation and groundwater pumping. If future increases in groundwater use for irrigation and other needs are also considered, the projected reduction in water storage and increase in drought could be even more severe.", "severity": 0.065, "event_locations": ["California"], "article_title": "Pokhrel & Felfelani: Two-thirds of Earth's land now under threat to go dry", "times": ["every year"], "probability": 0.67, "event_date": "2023-01-13T03:07:25.000000", "article_uri": "http://newsregister.com/article?articleTitle=pokhrel-felfelani-two-thirds-of-earth-%23039-s-land-now-under-threat-to-go-dry--1673625421--45095--", "translated": false, "article_index": "dashboard_climate_events_articles_translate"}, {"article_id": "GR2u74YB2sY1SAk0G2C1", "summary": "Ginger, 42, shared a video on Twitter on Friday showing her with other members of her GMA team as they \"barely took a breath for a half hour\" while covering an extreme drought in California.

These changes away from the arid drought-ridden conditions throughout the state may be a result of the deluge of rainfall seen since the start of 2023, caused by several atmospheric rivers being flung from a bomb cyclone in the Pacific Ocean.

In the newly drought-free areas in Del Norte County, a large amount of rain fell over the past week. The rain has impacted other drought-ridden areas of the state, including Lake Shasta, situated around 170 miles north of Sacramento, which is the largest reservoir in California. Much more rain will be required to further lift California out of its drought conditions, however.

Swain calls this \"hydroclimate whiplash\" \u2014 the sudden jump from withering drought to violent floods. Historic drought across California left parched soils ready to drink up the winter rains, but it also created new hazards for flooding. Drought has also made wildfires more ravenous, leaving behind larger burn scars, which bring their own flood hazards.

The paganized modernity immersed in barbarism prepares with its own hands a scourge much more calamitous than the ancient Flood, a much wider destruction of the human race, with which it believes it can eliminate from the Earth, not the wicked but the good: those who remain faithful to the Lord and to his holy Law.

Moreover, it would be said that there is no use, that there will be no flood to escape. Worse still: the gigantic flood caused not by God's righteous anger but by the tide of man's iniquity is considered a regeneration, an opportunity to reduce the world's population on the basis of the delirious plans of the Great Reign. Just as there are those who deny the imminent flood, being themselves their wicked artifices, in their foolish claim to want to control atmospheric phenomena by geoengineering.

FEMA has published maps for many of Indiana\u2019s floodplains, but not for all of them. To cover the rest of the state, the DNR maintains floodplain maps for an additional 18,500 miles of Indiana streams. The state agency combined its maps with those created by FEMA to produce the Best Available Flood Hazard Area map. Environmental advocates maintain that the DNR map is the best resource for identifying flood-prone areas. That keeps flood waters from flowing as fast or rising as high, which also reduces erosion. Climate change analyses are increasingly predicting that flooding will become a major concern for American cities. She maintained that current state law \u201ccodifies what local floodplain administrators should be following\u201d as required by federal code, as well as state and local ordinances. She said the state\u2019s floodplain requirements \u2014 while\u201cmore restrictive\u201d than FEMA\u2019s \u2014 result in cost savings for 450 Indiana communities that purchase flood insurance. The Indiana Association for Floodplain and Stormwater Management urged lawmakers to let the Indiana Drainage Task Force work through the issue before making changes to the Flood Control Act. \u201cToday\u2019s flooding isn\u2019t yesterday\u2019s flooding, so maps can\u2019t be stagnant. \u201cBeing stagnant about how we manage floodplains is going to leave us at great risk going forward. As I look across the landscape, I can\u2019t see one other state, county, municipality, town or anybody that\u2019s working to rollback flood protections.\u201d The trend nationally is to increase flood protections because of the changing environment, Hoffman continued. Allowing Hoosier floodplain administrators to use the updated DNR maps \u201cprovides them with a really important tool,\u201d she said. Dr. Indra Frank, the Hoosier Environmental Council\u2019s director of environmental health and water policy, added that even if the bill is passed, language in the Indiana Flood Control Act that requires floodways to stay open so they can \u201cconvey flow\u201d will remain. That means it will still be illegal to build in the floodplain without a permit from the DNR. If local permit decisions are made with just the federal maps, more buildings are likely to be built in flood-prone areas, leading to flooded buildings and less healthy rivers and streams, Frank said. \u201cThe language that this bill would repeal helps to ensure that fewer properties are built in flood prone areas in the future,\u201d Frank said.", "severity": 0.038, "event_locations": ["Indiana", "Indiana", "Indiana", "Indiana"], "article_title": "Groups clash over floodplain map use", "times": ["last year", "\u201c today"], "probability": 0.35000000000000003, "event_date": "2023-02-15T04:52:58.000000", "article_uri": "https://www.kpcnews.com/outdoors/article_00449862-9486-503e-acaa-8ff7b4830207.html", "translated": false, "article_index": "dashboard_climate_events_articles_translate"}], "start_date": "2023-02-15T04:52:58.000000"}}, {"_index": "event_database", "_id": "oKbjAIgBYQoGEGka8DWK", "_score": 0.76191604, "_source": {"number_of_locations": 1, "end_date": "2023-02-15T13:01:41.000000", "runner_up": 17.741015207100002, "severity": 0.2, "country": "USA", "score": 21.0140152071, "probability": 2.4600000000000004, "number_of_sources": 1, "locations": [{"parent": "0000210028", "is_altername": false, "success": true, "name": "Grand Forks", "location": {"lon": -97.03285, "lat": 47.92526}, "parent_country": "USA", "id": "0000210076", "population": 59166}], "event": "winter storm", "articles": [{"article_id": "jh1K8IYB2sY1SAk0R8U_", "summary": "grand forks \u2014 Classes were delayed two hours in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks and some roads were closed Tuesday night into early Wednesday afternoon after a winter storm impacted the region.

We can work with nature to flood proof our settlements and drought proof our farmlands, even as we sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Our communities, the agriculture sector and our fish and wildlife are all impacted by water scarcity, and we all have to be working together to address the challenges that we are facing today and into the future.\u201d The drought declaration by Governor Kotek unlocks a number of drought-related emergency tools for water users, including assistance to local water users.

The current U.S. drought monitor has most of Jefferson County mapped in severe to exceptional drought status. The Oregon Drought Readiness Council, a standing body composed of natural resource, public health, and emergency response agencies, received requests from the Crook County Court and Jefferson County Board of Commissioners in January requesting Governor\u2019s drought declarations.
