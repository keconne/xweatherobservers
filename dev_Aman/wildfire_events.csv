Wayne King, deputy chief of staff for Rep. Mark Meadows FEMA recently awarded emergency aid grants for several counties in the western part of the state where fire personnel are working to control wildfires under gusty, dry conditions. Tillis’ office staff said Monday that they were keeping an eye on how local economies will be affected by potential drops in tourism due to the spread of wildfires across at least 10 counties. U.S. Reps. Mark Meadows, a Republican from Cashiers, and Patrick McHenry, a Republican from Denver, N.C., have spent time in communities affected by wildfire evacuations and billowing smoke."

In Central Texas, conditions are more conducive to wildfires during the winter because the area receives less rain and humidity levels are lower. Large portions of Steiner Ranch are listed in the high or elevated wildfire risk category on the City of Austin’s wildfire risk map."

At T-Mobile, we recognize the growing danger that wildfires present, which is why we’ve been evaluating how our 5G network can help reduce wildfire destruction and aid in preventing extensive damage while giving advanced warnings, so people have more time to safely evacuate. 5G technology powers critical early detection With fast speeds, large bandwidth and low latency, T-Mobile’s 5G is proving its ability to provide enhanced situational awareness and help bring better information to the front lines, notably, America’s rural West, where wildfires are increasing in frequency and severity. Our partnership with Pano AI – a disaster preparedness technology solutions provider – and Portland General Electric is a great example of how T-Mobile 5G is working to mitigate the effects of wildfires through early detection and response. Together, the partnership has deployed 5G-connected cameras that enable AI-powered active wildfire detection near Portland, Oregon, to identify the first signs of wildfires and help firefighters stop them before they have the chance to spread. Resilience Beyond wildfires, T-Mobile is also leveraging 5G and its resources to provide critical on-the-ground response to communities affected by major weather events. 2023 and beyond In the coming years, we will see 5G continue to play a critical role in spotting wildfires and other natural disasters well before they can be detected by other technologies, with the hopes that such detection techniques can be replicated on a global scale."

There are several systems at work to create this unwanted effect, including climate change, forest management practices and worsening drought and wildfires. “So we should start thinking about how we are going to deal with this, because we expect more dry periods in a warmer climate and we expect more fire in the mountains, so it’s giving us reasons to think about how were manage our forests, how we manage our water resources.” Wildfires are increasing streamflow throughout the western U.S., raising new threats for public safety and water management, according to researchers. One of the researchers’ key recommendations is that water managers factor the effects of wildfires on snowmelt into their short- and long-term planning, as the effects are unlikely to reverse any time soon."

We ask that if debris burning occurs, take proper precautions to prevent fires from escaping and becoming wildfires. The KFD says on average they and partners throughout the state respond to more than 1,000 wildfires across the Bluegrass State each year. Forestry officials say that public efforts can go a long way in reducing the occurrence of wildfire. Taking extra precautions with debris fires and campfires and being alert to forest arson can eliminate the majority of wildfires that occur in Kentucky. Officials say by taking the following steps, residents can help reduce the risk of a wildfire starting:"

Today, temperatures near 70 degrees, wind speeds over 30 mph and relative humidity values below 20 percent will support wildfire activity in grasses and fine fuels near San Angelo, Abilene, Childress, Lubbock and Midland. Moisture levels in vegetation across these regions should help firefighters keep wildfires relatively small. Underlying dryness and dormant grasses combined with relative humidity values near 20 percent and northerly winds forecast over 20 mph will support wildfire activity in South Texas near Del Rio, Alice, Kingsville, McAllen and Laredo. During the dormant fire season, which occurs during winter and spring, freeze-cured grasses across the state and increased wind speeds surrounding dry cold fronts support wildfire activity. The state generally experiences increased wildfire activity mid-February through mid-April during the dormant season. Texas A&M Forest Service has responded to 38 wildfires for 1,272 acres burned across the state since the beginning of the year. “As the lead state agency for wildfire response, our analysts and fire managers continuously assess and monitor conditions statewide,” said Wes Moorehead, Texas A&M Forest Service Fire Chief. “Even as we engage in response activities to support our partners and local jurisdictions impacted by Winter Storm Mara, we have personnel positioned across areas of concern that are prepared to respond to any new wildfire ignition.” In addition to wildfire response, Texas A&M Forest Service is tasked with supporting all-hazard emergency response across the state. “Whether it is responding to wildfire activity or supporting statewide response to all-hazard incidents, our personnel embody the service mission of the Texas A&M Forest Service.” For current conditions and wildfire outlook, visit the Texas Fire Potential Outlook https://bit.ly/3kemhbG."

Last week, several wildfires were contained in western regions of the state. More than 60 percent of Virgini’s wildfires occur in the spring, especially in March and April. Rising temperatures, low humidity and windy conditions increase the potential for wildfire and make them harder to extinguish. “The 4 p.m. burning law is one of the most important tools we have in the prevention of wildfires in Virginia,” said Virginia Department Of Forestry director of fire and emergency response John Miller. “The number one cause of wildfires in the Commonwealth is escaped debris burning, and the 4 p.m. burning law goes a long way toward reducing the risk associated with wildfires each year."
